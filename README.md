üßó My Struggles
The journey of building this project was filled with valuable learning experiences. Here are some of the key struggles I faced:

Authentication & Authorization:
Setting up Firebase authentication and ensuring secure navigation for authenticated users required multiple debugging sessions.

Responsive Design:
Ensuring a seamless experience across all screen sizes was challenging but rewarding after numerous design iterations.

Dynamic Tooltips:
Learning and integrating the react-tooltip package required adapting to new syntax and import rules.

Animation Integration:
Initially struggled to implement Lottie animations dynamically via URLs but resolved it by using local JSON files for better control.

State Management:
Handling complex states, especially for user authentication and navigation, demanded efficient context management.
