## üßó **My Struggles**

The journey of building this project was filled with valuable learning experiences. Here are some of the key struggles I faced:

- **Authentication & Authorization**:
  - Setting up Firebase authentication and ensuring secure navigation for authenticated users required multiple debugging sessions.
- **CRUD & DB Management**:
  - I face most errors in here, this is for me new experience, I face issues when I set a CRUD operations.
- **Responsive Design**:
  - Ensuring a seamless experience across all screen sizes was challenging but rewarding after numerous design iterations.
- **Dynamic Tooltips**:
  - Learning and integrating the `react-tooltip` package required adapting to new syntax and import rules.
- **Animation Integration**:
  - Initially struggled to implement Lottie animations dynamically via URLs but resolved it by using local JSON files for better control.
- **State Management**:
  - Handling complex states, especially for user authentication and navigation, demanded efficient context management.
